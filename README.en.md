## Introduction
This repository contains instructions, software and CAD models to allow regular users make their own physical Bitcoin coins.

## Definition
A Bitcoin coin is a tangible artifact, shaped as a coin, that allows its owner to store in it an arbitrary amount of bitcoin.

## History
The first physical coins were created by Mike Caldwell, under the commerecial name of ["Casacius coins"](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins). After a moderate initial success, they were discontinued in 2013, after receiving legal threats due to the fact that, according to the Department of the Treasure of the U.S., those coins constitute a mode of "transmission of money" which requires, in accordance with the U.S. law, obtaining specific licenses. As a result, the creator decided to retire them from the market, considering that obtaining those licenses was not worthwhile.

Later on, there have been some alternate commercial products, most of them have vanished from the market for different reasons.

Due to that, currently is not easy to acquire a Bitcoin coin from a commercial provider. This project is born to empower the end users to create such coins.

## Requisites
To make your own coin, you will need:

### Software
1. A Python 2.7 interpreter. 
   - Dependencies: 

     - **ecdsa** (Used for crytographical computations)
     - **pyqrcode** (Used to generate the QR codes of the coin)
     - **pypng** (Used by pyqrcode to generate png files)


2. ```bertocoin.py``` (in this repository). A script that generates the private/public keys of the coin, as well as their corresponding QR codes.

### Hardware
1. A filament based, 3D printer. 
Used to print the coin.

We used an Anet AB printer, but any Prusa or similar is perfectly valid.

    Notes: 
   - Due to the need to place some inserts during the printing process, resin printers CAN NOT be used.
   - The recommended material is PLA plastic.
   - The design is optimized for an extruder head of 0.4 mm.

2. A Laser/Inkjet printer.
Any domestic-grade printer can be used. However, it is highly recommended to use original ink/toner as well as looking up the durability of the printed material in the documentation of the manufacturer. 

3. DIN A4 paper.
We recommend using white or yellow office paper with a grammage of de 90 gr/m2 or superior.

4. Washer.
The design prescribes the insertion of a metallic washer to confer total opacity to the secret key stored inside of the coin.
The recommended washer has a thickness of 2 mm and an external diameter of 30 mm.

5. Transparent metacrilate laminate of 1 mm of thickness.

## Using the software

1. If your computer doesn't have already a Python 2.7 interpreter, you have to begin by installing it.
Plese follow the instructions of the manufacturer of your operating system.

    Download links: 
    
    - [Python 2.70](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-270/)
    - [Otras versiones](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. If they are not previously installed, you must allso install these Python packages: **ecdsa**, **pypng** and **pyqrcode**. 

You can use the following commands:

     pip2.7 install ecdsa
     pip2.7 install pypng
     pip2.7 install pyqrcode

3. Download the script 'bertocoin.py' (from this repository) in a directory where the user has write permissions.
   
4. From that directory, launch the following command:

   ```python2.7 bertocoin.py```


>           It is possible to specify different options to gain a finer
>           control over the generation of the data of the coin. 
>           To know all the available options, you can issue this command:
>
>           python2.7 bertocoin.py -h
       
       
5. Once the program has been launched, it will create a sub-folder, named **delete-me**, inside of which a file named **print-me.svg** will be created.
This is a file, in the Scalable Vector Graphics format, that contains a the instructions and the template that we have to print and insert within the 3D coin.


> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> The user user has 3 minutes to print this file.
> After that, the **delete-me** folder and all of its content will be automatically deletec, since it contains
> the private key with which the coin's funds can be accessed.
> If the automatic deletion fails, for any reason, it is **imperative to manually delete** the 
> folder **delete-me** and all of its content.
> If you don't do it, it is ALMOST CERTAIN that you will lose your Bitcoin funds if some malicious actor
> gets access to the information cointained within that folder.
>
> The private key will be derived from a text seed, randomly generated by the program.
> If you'd like to provide your own seed, you can use the proper option of the script.
> To know all the available options, please launch the script with the option -h.
   
## Printing and placing the template

</p>
The printable template is available within this repository. 

The file _print-me.svg_ contains a template that you must cut out and place inside the 3D-printed coin.
Here, we can see an example:

<p align="left">
  <img src="./imagenes/bertocoin_print-me_ejemplo.png">
</p>

The template will be similar to this:

<p align="left">
  <img src="./imagenes/bertocoin_caratula_ejemplo.png">
</p>

You must print and cut out the template **before** initiating the process of 3D printing the coin.

Once the template has been printed and cut out, you must use the transparent metacrylate laminate to cut out a piece, shaped as an hexagon, with the same dimensions as the template you have just printed.

You must pause the 3D printing process of the coin approximately when it is halfway.
You will then insert, in this order:

1. The hexagon-shaped piece of metacrylate.
2. The template, previously folded as indicated in the printed page, and leaving visible the side identified as "COIN_XXXX_PUBLIC".
3. The metallic washer, that confers opacity to the private key, next to the template to ensure that it stays in place when the 3D printing of the coin is resumed.

Once these three inserts have been properly placed, you can resume the 3D printing process.

## Using the coin

You can consult instructions on how to use the coin in this PDF file: "Bertocoin - Manual del Usuario".
